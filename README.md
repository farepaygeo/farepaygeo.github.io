# exploring_bnr
This repository documents my final project for GES 600, Building Spatial Datasets. I explored GTFS data using the GTFStools package in R. I analyzed weekday service headways for MDOT MTA bus service in Baltimore City. I chose two "snapshots" of service from before the LINK redesign was implemented, and three snapshots of service after. I also plotted the extent of some of the routes in the network that were changed in LINK. Included here are all the GTFS I used as well as a site built with Quarto that presents my process and findings. This site will be updated over the coming weeks with improved plots and more details about the project. For now, enjoy my scripts and initial observations.
